# iris_KNclassifier

As a beginner for Data Science or machine leanring we start with basic Machine learning models.
There are 2 types if models "Supervised and Unsupervised". This iris data set belongs to Supervised learning 

Supervised learning: In this model user provides the algorithm with input and desierd output 
Example:
       # Identifying the zip code from handwritten digits on an envelope
         Here the input is a scan of the handwriting, and the desired output is the actual
         digits in the zip code. To create a dataset for building a machine learning model,
         you need to collect many envelopes. Then you can read the zip codes yourself
         and store the digits as your desired outcomes

There are many classifier model's in ML. but by the end of the day what ever model you use your requirments should be satisfied.
